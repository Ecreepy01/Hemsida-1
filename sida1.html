        	Nazi Germany developed numerous tank designs during World War II. In addition to domestic designs, Germany also employed various captured and foreign-built tanks. By doing this Germany saw their tanks grow from "tiny five ton packages to one hundred-ton monsters".

            The tank was in service from <b>1942</b> and fought to until the end of the war. It was deployed in North Africa and Eastern Europe usually in independent heavy tank battalions. The Tiger had the best technology at the time and had a weight of <b>56 tons</b> which led to a lot of breakdown and other mobility problems. The tank had thick armour for it's time. It had <b>100mm</b> at the front of the hull, <b>80mm</b> on the sides and rear and on the turret it had up to <b>120mm</b> at the front, and <b>80mm</b> on the sides and rear. The tank was armed with a <b>8,8cm kwk 36 L/56</b> gun as primary armament and 2 <b>MG34 machineguns</b> as secondary. The tank had a <b>Maybach HL230 P45 V-12</b> engine which gave it a maximum speed of <b>45km/h</b>.

            The Panther was a medium tank deployed on the Eastern and Western Fronts in Europe from <b>mid-1943 to its end in 1945.</b> The Panther was intended to counter the Soviet T-34 and to replace the Panzer III and Panzer IV. Nevertheless, it served alongside the Panzer IV and the heavier Tiger I until the end of the war. It is considered one of the best tanks of World War II for its excellent firepower and protection, although its reliability was less impressive.
